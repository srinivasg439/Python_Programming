        "\n",
        "Ans : Bar charts are good for comparisons, while line charts work better for trends. Scatter plot charts are good for relationships and distributions, but pie charts should be used only for simple compositions â€” never for comparisons or distributions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans : Compound interest makes your money grow faster because interest is calculated on the accumulated interest over time as well as on your original principal. Compounding can create a snowball effect, as the original investments plus the income earned from those investments grow together.\n",

The dtype value is the maximum length of a string in such data. Meaning suppose if any new string we wanted to add, then we can add only that string which have the length either equal to that dtype value or less than that. If any string which are adding and if its length is more than the dtype value then it will only accpet to maximum length and rest of the characters will not be included."
